proposition post DB v1 : 

# Overall ideas, questions, standars: 
- timestamps in DB should be in UTC.
- Timestamps format ?  :
	- "last_time_saw_at": 1743076209,		
	 or
	- "last_time_saw_at": "2025-03-27 11:50:09"	
- The endpoints should be thought in bulk and not single transfer to improve speed of data treatment.
- We will have a lot of data in a short period of time, avoid Joins



1.  **Service for:** table."raw_data_income_ia" : constantly checking the table and updating it with flaging:
	- copy cats
	- what is important and not important to take in count.
2.  **Service for:** table."runner_status" : checking new income data from table."raw_data_income_ia" calculating and adding updates to  table."runner_status"

## table name : checkpoints
maybe we will have 1 or 2 or 4 stations. 
Crucial information we need to know if its the begining point checkpoint.

| 	**is_starting_checkpoint**	|   tiny int (BOOL)		|						| we need to know wich one is the starting point |

## table name : participant_data
Table qui aura tout les participants donn√©e jsp si c'est neccesaire, age, etc etc

POST : json post prototype:

## table_name : raw_data_income_ia
Table income data from IA.
REMINDER : Nours will check in another script if the runners_id exists.
REMINDER : we will have multiple amount of income data from the same checkpoint we should take count of the first one the others is rubish.

| 	**is_noise_data**				|   tiny int (BOOL)		| DEFAULT=FALSE 		| REMINDER: by checkpoint we will have several almost same data (maybe some seconds of differnce ), we need to take the first one the others almost the same we don't use them |





### POST POST prototype: 
```json
[
	{
		"income_id_runner": 123,
		"image_id": "ovfsofgnbdfknbl-852489",
		"last_time_saw_at": 1743076209,			// or "last_time_saw_at": 2025-03-27 11:50:09
		"checkpoint_id": 3,
		"is_starting_checkpoint": false
	},
	{
		"income_id_runner": 123,
		"image_id": "ovfsofgnbdfknbl-852489",
		"last_time_saw_at": 1743076209,			// or "last_time_saw_at": 2025-03-27 11:50:09
		"checkpoint_id": 3,
		"is_starting_checkpoint": false
	},
	{
		"income_id_runner": 123,
		"image_id": "ovfsofgnbdfknbl-852489",
		"last_time_saw_at": 1743076209,			// or "last_time_saw_at": 2025-03-27 11:50:09
		"checkpoint_id": 3,
		"is_starting_checkpoint": false
	}
]
```


### PUT prototype
In the moment we want to say that we treated these information.
**We neeed a way to treat these in bulk and not one by one.**
```json
{
	"id": 74156,
	"is_treated" : true,
	"income_id_runner": 46523 // Maybe they need to change the income_id_runner because it was false.
}
```

another version : 
in URL : https:/api/endpoint/:[array-of-IDs]
and the Query will set all of then to TRUE. and is SQL that will manage that.

---

### Maybe we would need a GET 
### json GET prototype: 
- GET by is_treated=FALSE && is_noise_data=FALSE

In bulk will GET the data not treated.

```json
[
	{
		"id": 74156,
		"income_id_runner": 10,
		"last_time_saw_at": 1743076209,			// or "last_time_saw_at": 2025-03-27 11:50:09
		"checkpoint_id": 3,
		"is_starting_checkpoint": false
	}, 
	{
		"id": 846,
		"income_id_runner": 60,
		"last_time_saw_at": 1743076209,			// or "last_time_saw_at": 2025-03-27 11:50:09

	},

		"checkpoint_id": 3,
		"is_starting_checkpoint": false
	},
]

## Table_name : runner_status

- we can set to all runners a 0 lap with the timestamp of the begining of the race. 

table where the data is cleaned related to matched runners.

### GET / PUT by has_shown_in_front=FALSE
1. GET by has_shown_in_front=FALSE
2. PUT set all ids to has_shown_in_front=TRUE
after getting and receibing a check from the FRONT that i received the data we need to set all has_shown_in_front to FALSE.
In a query set all to false (we don't need to pass by an endpoint).

### POST prototype:

Before POSTING we will need to GET by last inputed data by id_runner to compare that and do the calculations updates. 
 - calculations of things : 
 	- "time_spend_current_lap" = "last_time_saw_at" - "current_time_saw" 
	- **"average_speed" = ~2.5km something with "time_spend_current_lap"**
	- **"runner_current_position" = ??**
	- total_time_runned = start_race_timestamp (beginning 0 lap for everyone at the begining) - "last_time_saw_at"
	- "amount_of_laps_runned"  = "amount_of_laps_runned" + 1
